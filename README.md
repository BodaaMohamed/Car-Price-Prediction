## 📚 About the Project

This repository contains a well-structured Jupyter Notebook designed to **clean, preprocess, and prepare data** for a car price prediction machine learning pipeline.

The project lays the groundwork for training models such as **Linear Regression**, **XGBoost**, **Decision Trees**, and more by ensuring the dataset is analysis-ready.

## 📦 Installation

First, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-price-data-preprocessing.git
cd car-price-data-preprocessing
```

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
```

---

## 🧪 How to Use

Launch the notebook with:

```bash
jupyter notebook pre-pare-data.ipynb
```

Then, step through each cell to:

1. Load and explore the data
2. Handle missing values and clean the dataset
3. Engineer features
4. Prepare the data for modeling
